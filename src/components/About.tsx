          I am a passionate Software & Blockchain Developer with hands-on
          experience in building web applications, decentralized platforms, and
          smart contract–based systems. I enjoy transforming ideas into scalable
          digital products using clean code and modern architectures.
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently, I am focused on Web3, Blockchain development, and full-stack
          engineering, working on projects such as decentralized exchanges, token
          systems, staking platforms, and AI-powered applications. I strongly
          believe in continuous learning and building real-world solutions that
          create impact.
